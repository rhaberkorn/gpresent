DESCRIPTION
    gpresent is a package for making presentations with groff and
    acroread.  It consist of a set of macros to be used with groff
    and a post-processor for manipulating the PostScript output of
    groff.  Without the use of the PAUSE macro, it can also be used
    for making slides.
